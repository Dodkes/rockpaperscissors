I focused on javacript and omitted responsive and design

<ol>
  <li>RPS works on the random array [1,2,3], where 1 = scissors, 2 = rock, 3 = paper</li>
  <li>Easy to use -> click on one of 3 img's on the left screen and GL</li>
  <li>There is no game end or game reset -> refresh the browser to start the new game</li>
  <li>After choosing 2 same items in a row, computer will counter-select the item you have chosen</li>
</ol>
